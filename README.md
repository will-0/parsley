# parsley.ai

Parsley is an AI-assisted platform for creating parsing algorithms. It is currently a work-in-progress.

## Guiding Principles

Parsley should strive to employ best practices, as defined by the highest level of evidence available.

## Design

Users should be able to upload examples of documents that they would like to parse (.pdf, .xlsx, etc.).

The AI will then ask questions to determine the business problem that the user is trying to solve. This includes:

- The desired output schema
- A sense for the variety of inputs to be seen

The AI will then attempt to generate an approximation of the distribution of input examples, based off of domain knowledge.

Finally, it will begin crafting a python library for reading this documentation. This should ideally be tailored to the user's experience level.

Please feel free to get in touch if you would like to get involved. I will respond to message to my LinkedIn account (listed on GitHub profile).

## Final notes

I know it would make more sense to call this 'parsely' or 'parse-ly'. I just like parsleyðŸŒ¿.
